## Development Setup
The D3.js was accessed by accessing the library files from the repository at [D3 repo](http://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js). 
Node.js was used along with browsersync library to create a local host environment and also facilitate auto-reload of the browser on every change in the html or css file. The command - browser-sync start --server --files ".html, css/.css" helps to track changes in the html/css files and auto-relod the browser.
